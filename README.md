This initiative merges data from Google Trends and the Pinterest API to deepen our understanding of the dynamics within the global fashion industry, assisting stakeholders in making informed business decisions.

## What Was Our Objective?

**Objective**: To analyze the geographical movement of fashion trends on a global scale.

## How Did We Approach This Project?

**Methodology**:
- **Data Collection**: Engaged in manual data collection encompassing 200 datasets and 40 fashion brands from five critical fashion hubs: the US, UK, Italy, Australia, and France.
- **Data Processing**: Used Python's pandas library for rigorous data cleaning and organization into detailed datasets.
- **Data Analysis**: Employed moving averages for data smoothing and developed delay matrices to quantify the rate at which different regions adopt trends.
- **Visualization**: Created heatmaps using Matplotlib and Geopandas to effectively illustrate the variation in trend adoption times across countries.

## What Did We Discover?

Our study explores how fashion trends propagate across different countries and identifies **patterns in their cyclical nature.**

Our analysis shows that contrary to intuition, for mainstream trends (such as adidas Gazelle) **the United States and Australia typically lead,** with European countries like Italy and the UK following them. 


## What Insights Are Available for Stakeholders?

This project offers strategic insights for fashion brands and marketers, suggesting a focused approach in areas that quickly embrace new trends. We recommend amplifying marketing efforts in the US and Australia due to their leading roles in trendsetting.

## What Challenges Did We Encounter?

**Challenges**:
- **Data Collection**: Navigated significant hurdles due to the restrictions on scraping Google Trends and the complex integration of multiple datasets.
- **Data Compatibility**: Encountered and resolved issues with code compatibility and data representation, choosing heatmaps as the most effective method to summarize our findings.

## How Can This Project Be Improved?

Future enhancements could include the development of an interactive dashboard that allows real-time trend mapping and the integration of predictive algorithms to forecast the directions of future fashion trends.

## How Can You Contribute?

We welcome contributions to refine data collection methods, enhance the visual representation of data, or improve the predictive accuracy of trend movements.
